# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
I spent a lot of time debugging the front-end last semester in the database project, mostly Javascript


## How difficult was this assignment?
Very easy


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Sourcetree and Github classrooms


## How could this assignment be improved?
Maybe add a little more to it than just the button


## Any other comments?
Looking forward to this class. My DB group last semester was a... difficult experience, so it will be nice to have more structure behind it and a new group of people to work with.
